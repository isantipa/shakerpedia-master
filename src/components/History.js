        <h2>History of cocktails</h2>
        <p>
        Cocktails, a beloved element of social gatherings, have an intriguing history that dates 
        back centuries. The origin of these artful concoctions is as complex and layered as the 
        drinks themselves, with a past steeped in mystery, innovation, and creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
        The word "cocktail" first appeared in print in the early 19th century, in an American 
        newspaper, referring to a stimulating drink made of spirits mixed with sugar, water, 
        and bitters. However, mixed drinks themselves have been part of human culture for much longer, 
        tracing back to ancient times. Civilizations like the Sumerians and Egyptians were known to 
        create primitive mixtures of alcohol, fruit juices, and spices.

        In the 1800s, during the so-called "Golden Age of Cocktails," the cocktail started its 
        ascension into high society, symbolizing refinement and elegance. It was during this period 
        that the first bartenders, also known as mixologists, started to gain prominence.  
        </p>
        <p>
        Among these pioneers was Jerry Thomas, often regarded as the father of American mixology. 
        His book, "How to Mix Drinks or The Bon Vivant's Companion," published in 1862, was one of 
        the first guides to cocktail making and bartending. It set the groundwork for the artistry 
        and science of crafting cocktails.

        Another significant figure was Ada Coleman, who began her career at The Savoy Hotel in London 
        in the early 1900s. As one of the first female bartenders, she was known for her creativity 
        and skill, crafting iconic cocktails such as the Hanky Panky.  
        </p>

        As Prohibition hit the United States in the 1920s, the cocktail culture went underground, 
        leading to the birth of the speakeasy and a plethora of new drinks designed to mask the taste 
        of poorly-made alcohol. However, after Prohibition ended, the cocktail scene rebounded and 
        continued to evolve.  
        </p>
        <p>
        The mid-20th century saw the rise of tiki culture, popularizing tropical drinks like the Mai 
        Tai and Pi√±a Colada. In recent decades, mixology has evolved into a respected craft, with 
        bartenders worldwide experimenting with local ingredients, modern techniques, and inventive 
        presentations.  
        </p>
        <p>
        Today, the art of making cocktails is a revered tradition that continues to captivate and 
        evolve, as mixologists around the world push the boundaries of flavor, presentation, and 
        creativity.
